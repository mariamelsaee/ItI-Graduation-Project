# ItI-Graduation-Project
This project harnesses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recreate images of loved ones who have passed away. By using advanced Al, it offers a unique way to preserve cherished memories and reconnect with those we've lost. While this technology brings emotional healing, it also raises important ethical considerations
